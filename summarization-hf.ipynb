We're going to need a job. We need you to show us how to fish for ourselves'.\"\\nFrom there, his Koto project was launched.

You can already check out live sportâ€Šâ€Šsuch as NBA matches â€Šand settle in for virtual big-screen Netflix viewing, which is oddly enjoyable.\\nIt's early days for Daydream, but there are promising signs that good content is on its way, mostly thanks to services that Google already owns such as Street View and YouTube.\\nThe latter's 360-degree video offerings lack any actual interactivity, but do provide some breathtaking visuals without having to wait too long for content to download.\\nOne of Google's goals with Daydream is to make something that doesn't look and feel overwhelmingly nerdy.\\nThe headset is covered in a nice, light fabric that at least on the surface looks more comfortable than Samsung's plasticky Gear VR.\\nBut once you put it on, you immediately notice Daydream's significant design flaws - problems that don't seem to have been created by hardware limitations but simply by bad decisions.\\nI'll start with the most serious. When you fire it up, chances are Daydream will be out of focus. Blurry images in VR are a terrible thing - it increases the already high risk of feeling disorientated or nauseous.\\nOn Gear VR, there's a focus dial on top of the device that gives you a few millimetres of adjustment space to sharpen things up.\\nBut on Daydream there is nothing of the sort - you're instead required to shift the device around your forehead until you get something that works with your eyes.\\nThe resulting position, in my case, wasn't as comfortable as it should have been.\\nDaydream's rigid shape seems to ignore that peoples faces aren't all the same.\\nFor me, the headset didn't sit snugly over my nose, which meant a line of natural light crept up through the bottom at all times.\\nFlaws like this ruin the VR effect of being transported to a different world.\\nThe illusion never has a chance to take hold.\\nThis problem is made worse by Daydream's limited field of view.\\nYou never get away from the feeling that you're viewing this virtual world through a small, restrictive circle.\\nThat potential world is made smaller still due to Daydream's solid back.\\nWith Gear VR, the phone's rear camera can be turned on to offer a sort of augmented reality that lets you look out into the real world while keeping the headset on.\\nBut with Daydream, the phone is tucked into a little pouch, blocking the ability for the rear camera to see anything.\\nAnd as I mentioned, the Pixel XL gets extremely hot.\\nWear it long enough and you'll really start to feel the heat, though Daydream doesn't fog up in the same way Gear VR doesâ€Š - a major plus there.\\nWhere Google has got it very right is with its little controller.\\nYou use it to interact with everything in Daydream, and it's a terrific bit of hardware that is instantly intuitive and delightfully flexible.\\nIn WonderGlade, a game that plonks you in a cartoon theme park, the controller is used to full effect.\\nIn one section, it's used to control a game of tilt and roll. In the next mini-game, it changes into a magic wand, then a fire hose, and then a putter.\\nIt has a tendency to disconnect every now and then, which is a real frustration, but the amount of interaction it offers gives Daydream a big selling point over Gear VR, and even some of the high-end headsets.\\nPeople who want to use VR for gaming will naturally still want a wireless gaming controller. But for the vast majority of uses, the simple remote nails it.\\nI had higher hopes for Daydream when it was first announced in May. And I find it irritating that minor things, such as the focus adjuster, are missing and would have made a big difference.\\nBut Google's strategy to make Daydream the entry level headset that supports a wide range of smartphones gives it an undeniable advantage over its rival.\\nWe're still lacking a real killer VR app, and Daydream is already attracting bad ideas such as the Wall Street Journal's app, which mostly lets you read text and look at market data in VR - the most pointless adoption of technology since my grandmother used a tablet computer as a coaster.\\nBut there are signals that truly groundbreaking applications will come in time.\\nThe Guardian's Daydream app, for example, places you in a tiny cell in a US jail, a feeling of solitary confinement that no amount of written words could possibly emulate.\\nFor most people, VR won't be something they discover via the high-end PC gaming set-ups required for the top experiences today. It'll be this cheap and cheerful option instead.\\nRight now the technology isn't quite there, but it's getting closerâ€Š -â€Š and with Daydream, Google has gained an early advantage.\\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter and on Facebook</td>\n",
