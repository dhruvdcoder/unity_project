The first part of this tutorial involves model training and inference using Jupyter notebook. Please take a look at `summarization-hf.ipynb`, and refer to `summarization-hf.md` for detailed instructions on environment configuration and job scheduling.

The second part of this tutorial involves scheduling SRUN and SBATCH jobs on Unity using multiple GPUs. If you want to train or finetune models using multiple GPUs, it's recommended to use SRUN or SBATCH jobs. Please checkout the `multi_gpu` subdirectory for sample code and scripts, as well as instructions on how to run them.
